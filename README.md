# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Challenge Overview
After creating multiple analysis for Bobby, he wants us to create two more technical analysis. The first one is creating new tables showing the number of retiring employees by title. The second analysis is creating a table containing employees who are eligible for the mentorship program.

## Analysis:
To start the analysis I created an ERD (Table 1) in order to map out the existing databases. This allowed for a more organized and efficent workflow.

For our first deliverable to Bobby, I create a CSV file containing all of the employees who are retiring and their most recent title. After condensing this into a readable title we can see that out of the 90,398 people who are retiring from Pewlett-Hackard, the most come from the staff, who have 28,446 employees retiring. Overall there is 7 different titles that have employees retiring. Table 2 below provides us of the breakdown of the amount of retirements that will be occuring in the different job titles.

## Additional Suggested Analysis
An additional analysis that should be looked into is the amount of employees needed for each job title. This would allow us to figure out how many employees to hire after the employees in our "recent_title_retire.csv" retire.
